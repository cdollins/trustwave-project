Thread run: Each thread has to do the following

 1.  Picks 2 random accounts from N-user-accounts.
 2.  Transfers 'X' dollars from source-account to destination-account.
 3.  Go back to step-1

Thread Exit: The threads should all terminate when there is one account with zero balance.

Input: The executable can take three arguments

 *   'T': number of simultaneous threads to start.
 *   'X': number of dollars for each transfer.
 *   'N': number of user accounts

Output: The output will be the number of transactions it takes before the threads exit.
